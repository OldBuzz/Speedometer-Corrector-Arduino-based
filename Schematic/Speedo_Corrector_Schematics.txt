Speedometer Corrector Schematics
--------------------------------

Two schematics are provided. The non-KiCad one is the original one, which
includes a 74HC14 Hex Inverter with Schmitt-Trigger Inputs. The KiCad one is
the same, but without the 74HC14 chip.

The original design included this Schmitt Trigger buffer to clean up incoming
signals. But the AVR ATmega328 chip on the Arduino Pro Mini (and Nano and Uno)
has Schmitt Triggers on the input circuits. The characteristics between the
AVR and the 74xx chip are a little different. After using the circuit with the
74xx chip for a couple of years, I found that I didn't need it in my 2005 Jeep
Wrangler. I removed the chip and jumpered across where the buffer had been
(pin 1 to 2). But this may not be the case for all vehicles. The voltage levels
and hysteresis is different between the two chips, do you might need the 74xx
chip for a different vehicle.

The Jeep supplies a regulated +5V to the Vehicle Speed Sensor, but a different
vehicle may require the addition of a voltage regulator.

The Jeep computer (PCM/ECM) internally pulls up the sensor signal with a 1K
resistor. The transistor in this circuit is wired as open collector, to pull
down the signal as needed. A different computer may need a different circuit.
