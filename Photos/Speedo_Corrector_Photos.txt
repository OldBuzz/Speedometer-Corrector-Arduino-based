Speedometer Corrector Photos
----------------------------

For this initial version, I used point-to-point wiring on a sea-of-holes board,
with screw terminals for the cable connection. This was a first experimental
version, which turned out to work just fine without much tweaking.

Notice that the markings on the red DIP switch were sanded off, since they were
opposite of what is needed. The Arduino Pro Mini socket is made by butting
6-pin female headers together, which requires sanding the ends.

I used the 74HC14 Schmitt Trigger for a long time, but then realized it is not
needed since the Arduino input pin has a Schmitt Trigger built in (see the
jumper in the socket on Board_05.jpg).

The board is not small, and it's in a bulky case. This could be made much
smaller with a custom PCB, and without the 74HC14, and without the screw
terminals.

The optional cable has two automotive connectors matching the ones at the
Vehicle Speed Sensor on the transfer case. This allows it to be connected into
the system, and removed if needed, without altering the vehicle wiring.

Alternatively, the cable could be spliced into the wiring under the hood, with
no pricy connectors matching the vehicle. But a 4-pin waterproof automotive
type connector is still recommended for easy removal.

The DIP-switch must be oriented correctly (which will probably look wrong).
The "ON" side should be where the wires connect to the Arduino, with the "OFF"
side grounded. Be sure to get it right, or nothing will work. After soldering
the DIP-switch onto the board, and verifing it is oriented correctly, sand off
the markings. The 1-7 switches are now bit 0-6, and the 8 switch is now
Increase/Decrease. The "ON" side now is zero, and the "OFF" side is now one.
An open switch (off) allows the Arduino to pull the signal up, and a closed
switch (on) pulls the signal to ground, hence the inverted logic.
