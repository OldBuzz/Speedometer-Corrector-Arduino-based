Speedometer Corrector Parts List
--------------------------------

1	Arduino Pro Mini (5V, 16MHz)
1	74HC14, hex Schmitt Trigger (probably not needed)
1   Socket, DIP, 14-pin (probably not needed)
1   PN2222 transistor
1	8-switch DIP
1	Circuit board
2	Capacitor, 0.1uF
1	Capacitor, 0.01uF
1	Capacitor, 22uF
1   Resistor, 10 ohm, 1/4 watt
1	Resistor, 1K
1   Resistor, 4.7K
1	Jumper
1	Header, male 3-pin
2   Header, female, 12-pin (for Arduino socket)
1	Case
1	Connectors, 3-pin, male & female, for Vehicle Speed Sensor & vehicle cable
2	Screw terminal block, 2 pin

The 74HC14 hex Schmitt Trigger, and its socket, are probably not needed.

The DIP-switch markings will be opposite of how we will use it. The markings
on the top should be sanded off to avoid confusion.

The screw terminals can be eliminated if you solder the wires directly to the
circuit board.

The automotive connectors for the Vehicle Speed Sensor on the Jeep Wrangler TJ
(1997-2006) are Aptiv (formerly Delphi) APEX 2.8 parts from Mouser. You may or
may not need these connectors, depending on how you connect the Speedo
Corrector to your vehicle. The part numbers seem to have changed, possibly more
than once.
  Connector housing, male    54200312  aka  15394689
  Connector housing, female  54200308  aka  10757671
  Connector pin, male        10762775-L  aka  54001801-L  or  54001801
  Connector pin, female      10757690-L  aka  54001800

A 4-pin automotive waterproof connector may be used to make the Speedo
Corrector detachable. The AMP SuperSeal 1.5 series works well (apparently
discontinued, but a variety of Chinese knock-offs are still sold on Amazon).
